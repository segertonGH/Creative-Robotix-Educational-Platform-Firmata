 Creative Robotix: line detection 

 This example uses Codees 5 line sensors to detect the presence of a
 black line drawn against a while background.  Ideally the black line should be
 about 15mm wide, or roughly the half the distance between two sesnors.  Codee
 uses the sensors calculate a weighted sum average biased by the weight of the 
 middle sensor (see calculation below).  This returns a single value, where 
 a value of 0 means Codee is centred over the line, a negative none zero value
 means Codee is to the left of the line (and should steer right) and a positive
 none zero value means Codee is to the right of the line (and should steer left). A
 return of 5 indicates that that all sensors of on the (black) line, while a return 
 value of of 6 indicate that all sensor are off the line.

 linePosition = (SUM(all sensors positions on line) / number of sensors on line) - middle sensor position
